 Airbnb Clone Frontend
This project is a frontend clone of the Airbnb website, built using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the visual design and user interface of the Airbnb platform, allowing users to explore listings, view property details, and get a feel for the Airbnb experience.

Features
Responsive Design: The frontend is designed to be responsive and adaptable to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Listing Display: Users can browse through a curated selection of property listings, each displaying key information such as property images, title, price, and location.

Search and Filter: A search bar and filter options enable users to refine their search based on location, dates, property type, and other criteria, enhancing the user's ability to find their desired accommodations.

Property Details: Clicking on a listing opens a detailed view, showcasing additional images, property description, amenities, and host information.

User Authentication: Although this project focuses on the frontend, a static user authentication feature is included to simulate the login process.
